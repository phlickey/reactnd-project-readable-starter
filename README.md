# Readable

Submitted in completion of the react developer nanodegree.

## Installation
To run, clone this repositoru using 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/phlickey/readable-readtnd-project2.git
```

Then access the code by navigating to the project directory:

```
$ cd readable-readtnd-project2
```
Next install the project using npm:
```
$ npm install
```
Installing should install dependencies for both the api server and the client. It will also trigger a fresh build.

This project consists of a server and a client. To start both, run 
```
$ npm start
```
from the parent directory. This will both start the api server on port 3001 and
serve the client on port 3000.

## Development

To start the client and the server manually and separately, first, navigate to the ./api-server directory and load the server.

```
$ cd api-server
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then in another terminal window, navigate to the client directory, and do the same thing:
```
$ cd readable-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will start a development server that will live reload the code when changes to the /src/ directory are made.
